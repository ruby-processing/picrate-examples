### README
Remember you need to install processing sound library this way:-

```bash
picrate --install Sound
```

To install other contributed libraries eg `minim` [see documentation][docs]
especially on Buster you may need to install `pulseaudio`:-
```
sudo apt-get install pulseaudio
```
However it might not such a good idea unless you have a RaspberryPI4.
