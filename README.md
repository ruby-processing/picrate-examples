# picrate-examples
A very basic set of examples for picrate see also propane-examples (as they are easily translated). Can be autorun with `rake`.  The contributed folder exists for you to add your own (and submit as a PR). Note `circle_collision.rb` is expected to fail (FX2D sketches are not supported), to get it to run delete FX2D or replace with P2D.
