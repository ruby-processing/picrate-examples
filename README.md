# picrate-examples
A very basic set of examples for picrate see also propane-examples (as they are easily translated). Can be autorun with `rake`, contributed folder exists for you to add your own (and submit as a PR). You can use rubocop to warn of egregious errors that might embarrass you at a later date (not all warnings need be heeded).
