# picrate-examples
Examples for picrate see also JRubyArt-examples (as they are easily translated). Can be autorun with `rake`.  The contributed folder exists for you to add your own (and submit as a PR). Ordinarily we expect users to install these examples with `picrate -i samples` or for first time users `picrate --install` which also installs `geany` configuration. If you use `geany` as your editor, will be able to run files from the editor, to run individual sketches from command line `cd` to folder of sketch and `jruby --dev your_sketch.rb`. Passing the `--dev` flag speeds `jruby` start-up.
