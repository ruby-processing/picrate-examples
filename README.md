# picrate-examples
Examples for picrate see also propane-examples (as they are easily translated). Can be autorun with `rake`.  The contributed folder exists for you to add your own (and submit as a PR). Note since PiCrate-0.7.0 `AppRender(self)` has been replaced by `GfxRender(self.g)` because we do full access to `PApplet`, and `PGraphics` interface is sufficient.
